## How To Play
WAR is played between a player and a dealer which costs 1 credit. Both parties receive a random card. The cards are then compared to one another to determine which is higher in rank. The party holding the higher card is the winner. If the player wins, they are awarded 2 credits. If both cards are of equal rank, the player and dealer enter WAR. During WAR an additional card is drawn for both parties to determine the winner. If the player wins WAR, they are awarded 3 credits. However, if the player loses WAR, 1 credit will be deducted. The game is over when the player has run out of credits.
